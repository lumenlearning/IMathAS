<h3>RPM Task Library Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

<p><strong>What is <a href="http://www.transitionmathproject.org/dev-ed/index.asp">RPM</a>?</strong></p>
<p>The Rethinking Precollege Math project is a coalition of seven colleges within Washington State, 
organized to address locally-defined structural reforms in precollege math and c
ollectively addressing three core questions: 
<ul>
<li>What math do we teach in precollege programs, and why?</li>
<li>How do we teach this math, and why?</li>
<li>How do we know that students have learned the math?</li>
</ul>
Please see below for more RPM details.
</p>

<p><strong>What is the RPM Task Library ?</strong></p>
<p>The library is a growing collection of questions, activities, problems and 
strategies that are designed to improve students' conceptual understanding of 
precollege mathematics topics, and to help faculty better assess levels of understanding.</p>

<p><strong>Why another set of student tasks? </strong></p>
<p>The focus of RPM is on developing student's ability to think deeply about 
mathematical ideas and to use them effectively.  These tasks seek to go beyond 
merely developing greater procedural proficiency.  Many are contextual.  Many 
ask that students explain and give evidence of their thinking.  New understanding
about what and how we teach developmental math has led to faculty developing new 
lines of questioning that help move students from novice to expert thinking modes.  </p>

<p><strong>Who can use the tasks ?</strong></p>
<p>The library is open to all mathematics faculty.  Materials can be freely copied, 
edited, and replicated except where indicated.  Original authorship should always 
be acknowledged when reproducing and/or modifying the materials. </p>

<p><strong>Where do the tasks come from ?</strong></p>
<p>Tasks can be contributed by anyone with a <a href="http://www.wamap.org">WAMAP</a> faculty account.&nbsp; 
Initial contributions were largely from RPM faculty. </p>

<p><strong>What is the ranking about?</strong></p>
<p>The library invites users to rank the tasks and provide evaluative comments 
and suggestions.  Often that first try at a new approach may not be perfect.  We 
hope this feature will allow submitters and users alike to refine and improve 
the items in the library. </p>

<p><strong>Why are some tasks listed at more than one course level?</strong></p>
<p>Because some tasks can be explored at very different mathematical levels.  
They may be solved using very primitive numerical methods (Prealgebra).  
Or they may be solved using complicated algebraic ones (Intermediate Algebra).  
So the task may be appropriate for students in both of these courses.</p>

<p><strong>Why are so many of these tasks contextual in nature?</strong></p>
<p>Because RPM faculty have found that embedding procedural mathematics in a 
meaningful context both stretches students' mathematical understanding and 
makes abstract principles more meaningful.</p>

<p><strong>Why are some tasks characterized by needing both NO technology, or 
graphing calculators ?</strong></p>
<p>Again, many of these problems are approachable with a variety of techniques.  
Depending on an instructor's focus and students' capabilities, some problems will 
be solved without any technology.  However with say a graphing calculator available, 
the problem may go in another direction and can be extended in some significant way. </p>

<p><strong>What is a "ConcepTest" Question ?</strong></p>
<p>A ConcepTest question is a multiple choice question designed to facilitate 
collaborative student thinking, to quickly assess conceptual understandings 
class-wide, and to illuminate areas of confusion.&nbsp; To learn more, change 
the search criteria called ConcepTest? to "Yes" and open "About ConcepTests".</p>

<p><strong>More About the Rethinking Precollege Math Project (<a href="http://www.transitionmathproject.org/dev-ed/index.asp">RPM</a>)?</strong></p>
<p>
RPM is part of the larger Washington State <a href="http://www.sbctc.edu/college/e_studentcompletioninitiative.aspx">Student Completion Initiative</a> 
awarded to the State Board for Community and Technical Colleges by the Bill &amp; Melinda 
Gates Foundation grant in late September 2009. The 3-year project builds on and 
extends the successes of and lessons learned from the 
<a href="http://www.transitionmathproject.org/">Transition Math Project</a> (TMP), 
with a long-term goal of increasing student completion in pre-college math courses 
and student success in college-level math courses. RPM colleges have also worked 
closely with and been supported by the 
<a href="http://www.evergreen.edu/washcenter/home.asp">Washington Center for Improving Undergraduate Education</a>
