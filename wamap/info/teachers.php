<h2>More about WAMAP/IMathAS</h2>
<p class="ind">For an introduction to WAMAP, watch a <a href="http://www.imathas.com/AD1/AD1.html">quick four minute video</a>.</p>

<h4>Features</h4>
<p class="ind"><a href="http://www.imathas.com">IMathAS</a> is the software powering WAMAP.  IMathAS is a
web-based math assessment tool for delivery and automatic
grading of math homework and tests.  Questions are algorithmically generated so each student gets a
different version of each question, and numerical and math expression answers can be computer graded.</p>

<p class="ind">Beyond that, IMathAS includes basic learning
management tools, including posting of announcements, text files, and attachments, as
well as discussion forums.  In postings, assessments, and forums, IMathAS allows
accurate display of math and graphs, with simple calculator-style math entry and
point-and-click graph creation.

<p class="ind">If you have questions about WAMAP, feel free to <a href="mailto:dlippman@pierce.ctc.edu">email</a> for more information.</p>


<h4>Content</h4>
<p class="ind">Over 4000 questions from the arithmetic through calculus levels have already been written.
This began with 1200 questions translated, with permission, from <a href="http://webwork.math.rochester.edu">WebWork</a>
from the Univ of Rochester, and was expanded with development grant support from the Washington State Distance Learning Council.
The question set continues to grow with user contributions, and will soon be expanded further with another development grant from
the Distance Learning Council.
</p>

<p class="ind">Since you can adapt existing questions or create new questions, you can make sure questions address the topics
you wish to assess while helping expand the shared question library</p>

<p class="ind">Prebuilt courses for 11 courses from Arithmetic through Calculus have been created, allowing instructors to
get started quickly.</p>

<h4>Support</h4>
<p class="ind"><a href="/docs/docs.php">Use Guides and documentation</a> are available to assist you in getting familiar with WAMAP.  A full
online training course is also available, with video tutorials to walk you through using WAMAP.  Limited support is
available through <a href="mailto:dlippman@pierce.ctc.edu">email</a> and through the Support Course discussion forums.</p>


<h2>The purpose of this website</h2>
<p class="ind">WAMAP has been generously funded by the <a href="http://www.transitionmathproject.org">Transition Math Project</a> to
