<p>MyOpenMath runs on the free, open source, <a href="http://www.imathas.com">IMathAS</a> platform, providing
free hosted use of this platform in support of free, open textbooks.  The intent is to provide classroom use of
the platform, without any added cost to students, for schools unable to host their own install of
the IMathAS platform, and to provide students self-study opportunities.</p

<p>Be aware that this site is 
community managed and provides no direct technical support to faculty or students.</p>

<p>MyOpenMath began with wild dream back in 2005 that it would be great
to provide free online math homework for anyone who wanted to use it in place
of expensive publisher products.  The development
of open textbooks took that vision one step further - totally free online
math courses combining free online math homework with the best open textbooks, like the
ones listed on <a href="http://www.opentextbookstore.com/">OpenTextBookStore.com</a>.</p>

<p>Most of the homework content on MyOpenMath was originally developed for WAMAP.org, a Washington-state
installation of the IMathAS platform, serving thousands of students every quarter.  The 
content was largely created by faculty who developed it for use in their own courses.</p>

<p>The development of IMathAS and the content has been supported by several grant projects
as well as the time, effort, feedback, suggestions, and dedication of its users.
Grants from the <a href="http://www.sbctc.edu/college/e_elearning.aspx">Washington State eLearning Council</a>
and the <a href="http://www.transitionmathproject.org/">Transition Math Project</a> helped
develop the platform and create a large set of content.</p>

<p>Courses developed for
the Washington State <a href="http://www.opencourselibrary.org/">Open Course Library</a> project 
are a basis for many of the open courses found on MyOpenMath.  Others were contributed
by faculty, including <a href="http://mathispower4u.yolasite.com/">James Sousa</a> from 
Phoenix Community College.</p>

<p>In case you're curious, we receive a small referral fee from some of our print partners 
when you order books through links on our sister site <a href="http://www.opentextbookstore.com/">OpenTextBookStore.com</a>. 
We use that money to run this site and OpenTextBookStore.com, so if you decide to adopt
an open textbook, we'd love it if you ordered your printed copies through that site.  If a miracle
happens and we actually make more money than our hosting costs, our intent is use that revenue
to help promote the site and keep the content updated. </p>
