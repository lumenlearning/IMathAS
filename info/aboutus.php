<h2>What is MyOpenMath?</h2>

<p>MyOpenMath is a free, open source, online course management system for 
mathematics and other quantitative fields.  MyOpenMath's primary emphasis 
is to facilitate the creation and implementation of online homework and assessment, 
although it also supports content delivery on a limited basis.</p>

<p>MyOpenMath runs on the open source <a href="http://www.imathas.com">IMathAS</a> platform, providing
free hosted use of this platform in support of free, open textbooks like the
ones listed on <a href="http://www.opentextbookstore.com/">OpenTextBookStore.com</a>.
The intent is to provide classroom use of
the platform, without any required cost to students, for schools wanting a managed install of
the IMathAS platform, and to provide students self-study opportunities.</p>

<p>MyOpenMath.com is operated by the non-profit organization MyOpenMath.</p>

<h2>Sponsors</h2>

<p>MyOpenMath.com is supported in part by financial and in-kind contributions
   from corporate sponsors.</p>

<h2>Support</h2>
<p>Community-based support is available through active, open support forums and training videos.
MyOpenMath does not provide direct support for instructors or students.</p>

<p>If you are in need of more comprehensive support services beyond what is 
 available on MyOpenMath, then you should consider
 using a commercial homework system.  There are number of homework sites that provide
 homework for open textbooks with support services.  Some of these sites are
 MyOpenMath compatible, meaning most courses on MyOpenMath can be moved to that
 platform.

<h2>Our History</h2>

<p>MyOpenMath was born out of free, open source software developed by David Lippman,
a community college math professor in Washington State, starting in 2005.  With a little grant support
and a lot of his free time, David ran a state-wide installation of that software at wamap.org.
Faculty from around the state got involved, and collaboratively contributed much of the question
content now found on MyOpenMath.  Out of the Open Course Library project in Washington,
several complete courses based on open textbooks were created.  Other folks got involved,
including James Sousa from Phoenix College who contributed a huge collection of questions
tied to his video examples.</p>

<p>In 2011 David started MyOpenMath as a way to share with the world this software
system and all the great content that had been built around open textbooks.
He self-funded the site for the first year, then joined forces with Lumen Learning,
which had been using MyOpenMath with the Kaleidoscope Project.  In 2017, Lumen split
off their own version of MyOpenMath, called Lumen OHM, to help differentiate their
supported service from the free, community MyOpenMath site.</p>

<p>In 2018, the non-profit organization MyOpenMath was formed to be the official
entity operating MyOpenMath.</p>
