        <h3>OHM Desmos Interactives are here!</h3>

        <p>
            We’re excited to announce the release of Desmos Interactives, a new
            item type in OHM to support student learning and mastery of graphing
            concepts, leveraging the accessible and easy to use Desmos graphing
            calculator.
        </p>
        <p>
            Along with this platform feature release, we’re sharing a complete
            collection of College Algebra Desmos Interactives for faculty to
            either use as is or modify to best suit their students’ needs.
