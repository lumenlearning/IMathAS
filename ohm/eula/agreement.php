<h2>Terms of Service and End User License Agreement</h2>

<p>By clicking &ldquo;I accept&rdquo; or &ldquo;I agree&rdquo; or using the Services, you
    are entering into this Terms of Service and End User License Agreement (EULA), which is a binding contract with
    Lumen Learning. These Terms of Service (&ldquo;Terms&rdquo;) govern your access to and use of Lumen&rsquo;s
    website, courseware, other products and services (&ldquo;Services&rdquo;). </p>

<p>We use plain language in these EULA to make them easy to understand. Throughout
    you&rsquo;ll see (&ldquo;Lumen&rdquo;, &ldquo;we&rdquo;, or &ldquo;us&rdquo;) to refer to Lumen Learning, Inc. We
    also have employees, independent contractors, and other representatives that we refer to as (&ldquo;our
    Team&rdquo;). As a user of the Service or a representative of an entity that uses the Service, we refer to
    (&ldquo;you&rdquo;) in this agreement.</p>
<h3>Your license to use the Services</h3>
<p>Our Services are designed to provide students with uncommonly effective learning
    experiences and to put tools in the hands of educators that amplify their work and strengthen the connection
    between students and educators. The Lumen team creates, curates, and improves open educational resources and
    contributes that work to the commons. Our Services bring together our technology platform, open educational
    resources, intentional learning design, a community of passionate educators, and data analysis to deliver an
    educational experience that is constantly improving.</p>
<p>Subject to these Terms, we grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, and
    revocable license to use our Services.</p>
<p>Our Services use <a href="https://lumenlearning.com/about/whats-oer/" target="_blank">openly
        licensed educational resources</a>&nbsp;such as text, images, videos, interactive
    activities and other media (&ldquo;OER&rdquo;). Nothing in these Terms limits your rights granted under specific
    OER licenses.</p>
<p>You may use our Services if you can form a binding contract with Lumen, and only in
    compliance with these Terms and all applicable laws. You must be at least 13 years old to use our Services.
</p>
<p>Some of our Services are publicly accessible to anyone without the need for an
    account (&ldquo;Public Services&rdquo;) in one of our courseware platforms (&ldquo;Lumen Platform&rdquo; or
    &ldquo;Platform&rdquo;). You may use Public Services in compliance with these Terms</p>

<h3>What is included in Services?</h3>
<p>Lumen&rsquo;s websites, apps, digital products and everything that powers them are considered
    Services in this agreement.&nbsp;Our Services may contain links to
    third-party content that are not owned or controlled by Lumen. If you access any third party website, service, or
    content from Lumen, you do so at your own risk and you agree that Lumen will have no liability arising from your
    use of or access to any third-party website, service, or content. If you find something that isn&rsquo;t
    appropriate, we want to know about it. Please tell us, and we promise to listen and take whatever action we think
    is appropriate, including removing the link or replacing it with an alternative.</p>

<h3>Who can use the Services?</h3>
<p>The Services are available only to individuals, including but not limited to
    administrators or other representatives of Institutions, and students, who have gained lawful access to the
    Services directly from Lumen or its Third-Party Service provider or through the Institution with which such
    individual is affiliated (&quot;Authorized User&quot;). In order to access certain Services, you may be required
    to register for a user account (&quot;User Account&quot;) by providing your first name, last name, valid email
    address (and in the case of Enrollments, your Institution and Course name or code), and designating a secret and
    unique username and password (&quot;Account Credentials&quot;), as well as any additional information that may be
    required by your Institution. In some cases, your User Account may already be established for you by your
    Institution, or by way of direct access from an integrated Third-Party Service, such as a learning management
    system, each of which may have additional terms of use or requirements for account access. Lumen may use your
    Account Credentials to validate your account prior to providing access to the Services each time you access the
    Services.</p>
<p>You may have only one active User Account at any given time. You agree to provide
    accurate and truthful information when creating a User Account and to promptly update such information should it
    change.</p>
<p>You may not self-register for or otherwise access the Services if you are under the
    age of 13 unless your parent or legal guardian has established an account or registered on your behalf. If you are
    under the age of majority pursuant to the laws in your jurisdiction (typically under the age of 18), you may not
    register or use the Services without first obtaining permission from your parent or guardian. Where a parent or
    legal guardian registers or establishes a User Account on your behalf as a minor they will be contracting with
    Lumen on your behalf until you reach the applicable age of majority in your jurisdiction, at which point the
    contract will transfer to you. However, if you are under the applicable age of majority and enrolled at an
    institution of higher education, you may self-register for the Services.</p>
<p>Lumen reserves the right, in its sole and absolute discretion, to suspend or terminate
    your User Account, or take any other appropriate legal action, and your right to use or otherwise access any
    Service is automatically terminated, if you violate these EULA. Furthermore, Lumen also reserves the right to
    discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Services, or any part of the Services at any time.</p>

<h3>Availability of the Services</h3>
<p>You understand that the Services: (1) need Internet access to work; (2) may
    occasionally be offline for maintenance or emergencies; and (3) have features and functionality that may change
    over time.</p>
<p>The scope and availability of the Services may vary according to: (1) additional terms presented
    at the time of purchase or registration; (2) the specific Course or Service for which you&rsquo;ve enrolled or
    registered; and/or (3) any licensing terms between Lumen and your Institution. Lumen is not responsible for
    limitations of access resulting from any Third-Party Service or as the result of certain account settings
    established by your Institution.</p>
<p>While Lumen makes reasonable efforts to ensure the availability of the Services to
    Authorized Users with active Subscriptions, the Services may be unavailable for limited periods of time due to
    scheduled routine maintenance, emergency maintenance or factors beyond Lumen&#39;s control, such as disruptions of
    Internet services or unforeseen threats to the integrity or security of the Services.</p>
<h3>Acceptable Use Policy</h3>
<p>By accessing or using the Services you agree to comply with the terms of Lumen&rsquo;s Acceptable
    Use Policy (AUP). Lumen reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to suspend or terminate access to and the use
    of the Services, and/or take any other appropriate legal action, with respect to any user that Lumen reasonably
    believes has undertaken, or participated in, any activities that violate the terms of the AUP.&nbsp;Our AUP includes:</p>

    defamatory, vulgar, obscene, libelous, invasive of another&rsquo;s privacy, hateful, racially, ethnically or

    rights of any party. You must not impersonate any person or entity or falsely state or otherwise misrepresent your

</p>

<p>In addition, you represent and warrant that your use of our Services will
    comply with all applicable laws and regulations. You&rsquo;re responsible for determining whether our Services are
    suitable for your legal use.</p>

<p>The software we use to deliver the Services (the &ldquo;Software&rdquo;) is subject to
    United States export controls. Export laws are designed to restrict the distribution and use of certain products
    and services from other countries for security or trade agreements. You may not download or otherwise export our
    Services in violation of United States export laws.</p>

<h3>Security and Privacy</h3>
<p>We do our best to keep information secure. You can help by using a strong password
    and keeping it safe. We&rsquo;re also committed to transparent and ethical use of your information. </p>
<p>We care about your security. We maintain appropriate procedural, physical, and
    technical safeguards to protect the security, integrity, and durability of your account and your content. Despite
    our best efforts, we cannot guarantee that our methods will be effective in all circumstances. You&rsquo;re
    responsible for keeping your user account and password secure. Please notify us right away of any unauthorized use
    of your account.</p>
<p>We store information about your activity when you use our services, so we can learn
    from how users are engaging with our services and make them better. From time to time we
    may offer different versions of our services, including versions using different instructional techniques,
    different curricula, or different methods. We also use information about your activity to decide which version of
    our services are most beneficial to users. We also use information we store about you to
    troubleshoot issues.</p>
<p>When you post or update content, leave feedback, or reuse, remix, or revise your
    content or the content of others, we store information about that activity like the date, time, changes made, and
    other related data.</p>
<p>The information generated automatically by our services is often stored in log files
    and databases. These might also include things like your IP address, the address of the Lumen web pages you
    visited, the browser and operating system you were using, and other similar information.</p>
<p>Below are a few examples of the types of information our courseware generates
    automatically:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Content views</li>
    <li>Practice question use: date taken, individual question answers and
        results</li>
    <li>Graded assignment and assessment use: date taken, individual
        question answers and grades</li>
    <li>Time spent on each question</li>
    <li>Enabling of automated messages</li>
    <li>Number of automated messages sent by the system</li>
    <li>Number of help messages sent by faculty to struggling students via
        the messaging tools</li>
</ul>
<p>You therefore give us, and third parties (with whom we work) permission to use, display, host,
    share, and back up Your Content such as the activity data noted above. By submitting Your Content, you also permit
    us to identify you by your username and as the contributor of Your Content.</p>

<p>We adhere to transparent, responsible and ethical practices around data ownership,
    sharing and use. Please read our <a href="https://lumenlearning.com/policies/privacy-policy/" target="_blank">privacy
        policy</a>, and our <a href="https://lumenlearning.com/policies/research-and-data-practices/" target="_blank">research

<h3>Content contributed by you</h3>
<p>Lumen may allow you to post content, including text, photos, video, links, and other
    materials. Anything that you post or otherwise make available using our Services is referred to as &ldquo;User
    Content.&rdquo; You are solely responsible for the User Content you upload, and you retain all rights in original
    content that you create. We also allow you to redistribute, revise and remix OER content in our Platform subject
    to the rights and requirements of the original content.</p>

<p>You grant Lumen and our users a non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable,

    to User Content, for example under other licenses. We reserve the right to remove or modify User Content for any
    reason, including User Content that we believe violates these Terms or our policies.</p>

<p>Following termination or deactivation of your account, or if you remove any User
    Content from our Platform, you allow Lumen to retain, reuse, revise, remix, and redistribute your User Content
    subject to the terms of the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/" target="_blank">Creative

<p>We&rsquo;re grateful for your feedback. In order for us to take advantage of it, you
    grant Us a worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free license to use and incorporate into the Services any
    suggestion, enhancement request, recommendation, correction or other feedback provided by you.</p>
