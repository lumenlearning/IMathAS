The course is organized around big mathematical and statistical ideas, presented in contextualized, collaborative, in-class student activities. Concepts include numeracy (with an emphasis on estimation and fluency with large numbers); evaluating expressions and formulas; rates, ratios, and proportions; percentages; solving equations; linear models; data interpretations, including graphs and tables; verbal, algebraic, and graphical representations of functions; and exponential models. The course helps students develop conceptual understanding, acquire multiple strategies for solving problems, and further develop the ability to read, write, and talk about mathematical concepts and applications.

MVP activities include a Teacher Edition with lots of specific notes about how to introduce the activity and guide students through challenging aspects as they work in groups.\r\n* Video Lessons: These are links to video lessons for student reference.
